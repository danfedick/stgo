If prompted by the browser to save the user ID and password (decline to save the user ID and password), this is a finding. \n\nLog out of the application and close the browser. Reopen the browser and examine the stored cookies. The cookies displayed should be related to the application website.\n\nThe procedure to view cookies will vary according to the browser used. Some modern browsers are making use of SQLite databases to store cookie data so use of a SQLite db reader/browser may be required.\n\nOpen the cookies related to the application website and search for any identification or authentication information. While authentication information can vary on a per application basis, this is most often specified as \"username=x\", or \"password=x\".\n\nIf the web application prompts the user to save their password, or if a username or password value exists within a cookie or within local storage locations, even if hashed, this is a finding.\n\nThe application may use means other than cookies to store user information.

Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, this persistence allows the web application developer to provide a robust and customizable user experience.\n\nHowever, if a web application stores user authentication information within a persistent cookie or other temporary storage mechanism, this information can be stolen and used to compromise the users account.\n\nLikewise, HTML 5 provides the developer with a client storage capability where application data larger than the 4K cookie size limit can be stored on the local client.  While this can be beneficial to the developer, this is considered insecure storage and should not be used for storing sensitive session or security tokens.  A cross site scripting attack can put this data at risk.\n\nWeb applications must clear sensitive data from files and storage areas on the client when the session is terminated.",

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application, or the patch management solution that is configured to patch the application, must be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates and patches at least weekly. Patches must be applied immediately or in accordance with POA&Ms, IAVMs, CTOs, DTMs or other authoritative patching guidelines or sources.",

        "description": "Use of automated scanning tools accompanied with manual testing/validation which confirms or expands on the automated test results is an accepted best practice when performing application security testing. Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as \"fuzz testing\". Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.\n\nMany vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications. All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.\n\nDue to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications. Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment.\n\nIt is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested. In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the website and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator. Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base. A code review requires complete code base access and is normally performed by the development team.\n\nIf vulnerability testing is not conducted, there is the distinct potential that security vulnerabilities could be unknowingly introduced into the application environment.\n\nThe following website provides an overview of fuzz testing and examples:\n\nhttp://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing",

        "description": "Threat modeling is an approach for analyzing the security of an application. It is a structured approach that enables you to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application. Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.\n\nThreat modeling can optimize application security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.\n\nThe lack of threat modeling will potentially leave unidentified threats for attackers to utilize to gain access to the application. To execute a threat model you should do the following:\n\n- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.\n\n- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.\nE.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.\n\n- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.\n\nCountermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.\n\nRefer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling",
