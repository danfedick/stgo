        "description": "Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). \n\nStandard operating procedure for placing an information system into a production environment includes creating a baseline configuration of the system.  The baseline configuration provides information about the components of the information system (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation, server, network component, or mobile device including operating system/installed applications with current version numbers and patch information), network topology, and the logical placement of the component within the system architecture. \n\nIt is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single information system, but doing so increases risk when compared to limiting the services provided by any one system.   This is particularly true when these services have conflicting missions, user communities or availability requirements.\n\nThis requirement addresses the need to provide an automated mechanism that will prevent the execution of programs not associated with the established baseline configuration.\n\nThis is a requirement to disable services as part of the baseline process and provide automated tools that monitor the system and prevent unauthorized system processes from executing. \n\nThis requirement will apply to configuration management applications, HIDS applications and other similar types of applications designed to manage system processes and configurations.

This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups. \n\nIn order to identify and report on what (repetitive) data has been removed via the use of audit reduction, the application must provide a capability to generate reports containing what values were removed by the audit reduction. \n\nAudit reduction does not alter original audit records.  An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy based requirements and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. \n\nReporting tools employing audit reduction methods must not alter the original audit data.  An example of a tool employing audit reduction methods is the Windows Event Viewer tool which is used to view and analyze audit logs on Windows systems.",
